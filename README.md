# 01_StructuredProgrammingExample

## This is example of structured programming paradigm:
1. Has no GOTO operators.
2. Any algorithm can be decomposed into basic constructions: sequences, conditionals, cycles.
3. Basic constructions can be nested within each other.
4. Any complex function can be decomposed into a set of subfunctions.
5. Semantically related functions are grouped into modules.
6. All constructions have one entry point and one exit point.
7. Any logically related instructions group should be arranged into a block.
8. The program development goes step by step with top-down method.

This code sample just shows my understanding of structured programming paradigm.
Do not consider that code as a best practice example.

## Assumptions
- Numbers have one digit and may have an unary operator;
- There is no validation: any input expression must be correct;
- Any complex operator must have spaces around it;
